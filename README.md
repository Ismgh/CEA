Improving the quality of  Polycube-Based Hexahedral Meshing by solving a binary problem.
Hexahedral meshes generated from polycube mapping often exhibit a low number of singularities but also poor quality elements located near the surface. It is thus necessary to improve the overall mesh quality, in terms of the minimum Scaled Jacobian (MSJ) or average Scaled Jacobian (ASJ). Improving the quality may be obtained via global padding (or pillowing), which pushes the singularities inside by adding an extra layer of hexahedra on the entire domain boundary. Such a global padding operation suffers from a large increase of complexity, with unnecessary hexahedra added. In addition, the quality of elements near the boundary may decrease. We propose a novel optimization method which inserts sheets of hexahedra so as to perform selective padding, where it is most needed for improving the mesh quality. A sheet can pad part of the domain boundary, traverse the domain and form singularities. Our global formulation, based on solving a binary problem, enables us to control the balance between quality improvement, increase of complexity and number of singularities. We show in a series of experiments that our approach increases the MSJ value and preserves (or even improves) the ASJ, while adding fewer hexahedra than global padding.
The algorithme is using glpk library to solve the optimisation binary problem and will return the set of facets that should be padded.
